# VBB GTFS Notebooks 

This repository includes ipython notebooks which visualize General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data of the Verkehrverbund Berlin Brandenburg (VBB). The data can be found at https://www.vbb.de/unsere-themen/vbbdigital/api-entwicklerinfos/datensaetze. The different files contain information on public transportation schedules, associated geographic information, transport operators, ticket fares etc. https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference

Explore the all notebooks and their output [here](https://codebardian.github.io/vbb-gtfs/).

The project was created as part of my ongoing effort to learn [`pandas`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and [`geopandas`](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas) with [`matplotlib`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) and [`seaborn`](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) visualization.
