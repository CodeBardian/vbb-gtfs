# VBB GTFS Data 

This notebook visualizes General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data of the Verkehrverbund Berlin Brandenburg (VBB). The data can be found at https://www.vbb.de/unsere-themen/vbbdigital/api-entwicklerinfos/datensaetze. The different files contain information on public transportation schedules, associated geographic information, transport operators, ticket fares etc. https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference

The project was created as part of my first attempt to learn `pandas` and `geopandas` with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` visualization.
